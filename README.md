# Spring Boot Database Connector Repository 🚀

I had a tough time figuring out how to connect different databases to Spring Boot projects, so I decided to create this repository to help others!  
This repository aims to provide pre-configured setups for connecting Spring Boot APIs to a variety of databases, making it easier for developers to get started.  

## 📚 Supported Databases
Here’s a list of the databases I plan to include in this repository:
- MySQL ✅
- PostgreSQL
- MongoDB
- Redis
- Neo4j 

Feel free to suggest any other databases you'd like to see here! Open an issue!
